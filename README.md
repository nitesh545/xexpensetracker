# Expense Tracker

## What is an expense tracker?

I recently realised that it has become a must for me to track where my money is going.
Majority of my money is going on packets of Lays...
<br>
But that is not all. So, the categories I came up with for tracking my expenses are:

1) Food
2) Entertainment
3) Travel

An expense tracker is a tool for my daily life to track my expenses.

## Why make my own tool?

Why not? I mean, first, its sensitive information. Second, freedom of customization.

## Technical corner

1) Add more money in balance
